          <p>Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,</p>
          <p>
            die ausgeschriebene Position als Product Owner Partner Neuausrichtung bei der HDI AG spricht mich sehr an, da sie meine
            langjährige Erfahrung in der strategischen Weiterentwicklung zentraler Plattform- und Partnersysteme mit meiner fundierten
            Branchenkenntnis im Versicherungsumfeld ideal verbindet.
          </p>
          <p>
            In meiner aktuellen Rolle als Product Owner bei der Insurfox GmbH verantworte ich die Weiterentwicklung eines zentralen
            Plattform- und Partnersystems im Schadenumfeld. Zu meinen Aufgaben zählen die Gestaltung der Produktvision, die Verantwortung
            strategischer Roadmaps sowie die Erstellung, Priorisierung und transparente Kommunikation des Product Backlogs. Dabei agiere
            ich als zentrale Schnittstelle zwischen Fachbereichen, IT, agilen Teams und externen Dienstleistern und begleite die
            kontinuierliche Weiterentwicklung der Plattform- und Anwendungslandschaft in Richtung modularer, skalierbarer Lösungen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ergänzend bringe ich umfangreiche Management- und Führungserfahrung im Versicherungsumfeld mit: Als Service Manager der
            Nobilas GmbH (Akzo Nobel) war ich für die Schadensteuerung sowie die strategische und operative Zusammenarbeit mit namhaften
            Versicherungskonzernen verantwortlich. In dieser Funktion steuerte ich ein bundesweites Werkstatt- und Partnernetzwerk und trug
            Führungsverantwortung für über 50 Mitarbeitende. Diese Erfahrung hat mein Verständnis für Partnerprozesse, Steuerungslogiken und
            die Interessen unterschiedlicher Stakeholder nachhaltig geprägt und bildet eine wertvolle Grundlage für die Neuausrichtung
            zentraler Partnersysteme.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meine berufliche Laufbahn ist geprägt von der Arbeit an komplexen Transformations- und Neuausrichtungsprojekten, in denen ich
            unterschiedliche Perspektiven zusammenführe, Teams in variierenden Führungsstilen moderiere und gemeinsam tragfähige Lösungen
            entwickle. Eine proaktive, analytische und lösungsorientierte Arbeitsweise sowie ein hoher Anspruch an Qualität, Transparenz und
            Zusammenarbeit zeichnen mich dabei aus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Die strategische Bedeutung des zentralen Partnersystems für die HDI Deutschland sowie die Möglichkeit, dessen zukunftsorientierte
            Weiterentwicklung aktiv mitzugestalten, motivieren mich sehr. Gern bringe ich meine Erfahrung, meine strukturierte Arbeitsweise
            und meine ausgeprägte Schnittstellen- und Führungskompetenz am Standort Hannover ein.
          </p>
          <p>Über eine Einladung zu einem persönlichen Gespräch freue ich mich sehr.</p>
          <p>Mit freundlichen Grüßen</p>
          <p>Ralf Mitterbauer</p>

          <h3>Application</h3>
          <p>Application for Senior Technical Product Manager – Platform &amp; Workflow Orchestration</p>
          <p>Dear Hiring Team,</p>
          <p>
            I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Technical Product Manager – Platform &amp; Workflow Orchestration role. The
            position strongly resonates with my background in owning and evolving mission-critical, horizontal platforms that coordinate
            complex workflows across multiple services, stakeholders, and regulatory constraints.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my current role as Product Owner / Technical Product Manager at Insurfox, I take end-to-end ownership of a central,
            revenue-generating platform within the insurance domain. This platform coordinates complex workflows across intake, validation,
            decision logic, partner interaction, and communication. My responsibilities include defining the product vision and roadmap,
            owning and prioritizing the backlog, and translating business, operational, and compliance requirements into robust, reusable
            platform capabilities. I work closely with senior engineers and architects to ensure scalability, reliability, and long-term
            maintainability while managing dependencies across multiple domains.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond my current role, my career has consistently focused on orchestration, coordination, and platform ownership in complex
            environments. Earlier, as Service Manager at Nobilas (Akzo Nobel), I was responsible for steering nationwide partner networks
            in the insurance claims ecosystem. I coordinated end-to-end workflows across insurers, service partners, and internal teams and
            held leadership responsibility for more than 50 employees. This experience deeply shaped my systems-oriented mindset and my
            understanding of how platform decisions directly impact operational efficiency, partner performance, and customer outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            What particularly attracts me to this role is the focus on an already live, business-critical orchestration layer where the
            challenge lies not in validation, but in improving performance, reliability, scalability, and economic efficiency under growing
            complexity. I am comfortable operating in environments where workflows are revenue-critical, highly interconnected, and subject
            to regulatory requirements, and where product decisions must balance technical integrity with business impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            I see the orchestration platform not as a technical abstraction, but as a product in its own right: one that enables
            consistency, quality, and speed across multiple services while protecting long-term platform health. I enjoy working at this
            horizontal layer, aligning product, engineering, operations, and compliance, and taking clear ownership when trade-offs are
            required.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in platform ownership, workflow coordination, and cross-functional
            leadership can contribute to the continued evolution of your orchestration platform. Thank you for your time and consideration.
          </p>
          <p>Kind regards,</p>
          <p>Ralf Mitterbauer</p>
