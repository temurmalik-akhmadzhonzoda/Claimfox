            <p class="hero-summary">The focus is a structured market overview for commercial fleet and logistics risks in Germany and the EEA, covering freight forwarding, contract and special logistics, and automotive and transport fleets. Modelled market exposure is around €24bn in Germany and around €250bn in the EEA. Exposure is explicitly not premium, revenue or contribution. The model uses risk drivers such as fleet counts, transport and cargo values, operating profiles, and claims frequency and severity. The objective is transparency on risk profiles to support portfolio steering, capacity allocation and underwriting decisions in partnership with Insurfox.</p>
